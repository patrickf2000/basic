<h1>Conditionals</h1>
<hr />

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Like all other programming languages, BASIC has support for conditionals. Conditionals are a little different from other languages, and may take a little getting-used to. Below is an example of a conditional (it asks the user for two numbers and compares them):<br />
<pre><code>
Var no1
Var no2

Define no1 as 0
Define no2 as 0

Input no1
Input no2

If no1 Greater no2
	PrintLine "Greater!"
Else no1 Less no2
	PrintLine "Less!"
Else no2 Equals no2
	PrintLine "Equal!"
Else
	PrintLine "What did you enter?"
Stop
</code></pre><br />
As you can see, the general idea is the same as in other languages; its just the implementation that is slightly different. You can compare numbers and strings, both hard-coded or in variables. The first statement always begins with If. All other statements begin with Else. If you want an else with no condition, simply use 'Else'. Else, with a condition, is the equivalent of 'else if' in other languages. Finally, end the entire statement with 'Stop'. 
</p>

<h3>Operators</h3>
<p>Unlike most other programming languages, BASIC does not use symbolic operators; we use words instead. The three operators are 'Greater', 'Less', and 'Equals'. What they do should be self-explanatory.</p>

<h3>Nesting Loops</h3>
<p>This is important. You CANNOT nest conditionals in BASIC. If you try to do so, you will create a conflict, and the program will get stuck (it shouldn't freeze your computer, though; Ctrl-C should kill it). If you must nest conditionals, you can enclose the next conditional statement in a function, and call that function.</p>
