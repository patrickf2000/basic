<h1>Using the Interpreter</h1>
<hr />

<p>The interpreter can be used in two ways: Shell mode and File mode. All commands are valid both in Shell mode and File mode, although some are meant more for shell mode.</p>

<h3>Shell Mode</h3>
<p>To use shell mode, simply run the program (the binary is called 'basic'). When you do so, you should be greeted with the a prompt that looks something like this:<br /><br /><code>BASIC> </code><br /><br />This is where you type your commands. All commands begin with a capital letter, and are case sensitive. If you wish to create a function (let's say its called 'Hello'), you will notice that the prompt will look something like this: <br /><br /><code>BASIC> [Hello] </code><br /><br />To change the prompt title, you can use the 'Program' command, like this:<br /><br /><code>BASIC> Program Hello<br />Hello> </code><br /><br />To exit the interpreter, use the 'Exit' command.</p>

<h3>File Mode</h3>
<p>File mode is very easy. To do so, simply run the basic binary, followed by the path to your file name (if the file is in the current working directory, just the file name will do). Basic currently takes no command line parameters. If you want author and license information, go to shell mode and use the 'Author' command. To see version information, use the 'Version' command. Note that you are not limited to just one file. In file mode, you can pass as many programs to the binary as you wish; they will be executed one at a time.</p>
