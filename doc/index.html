<h1>Welcome to BASIC!</h1>
<hr />

<p>Welcome to the documentation for this BASIC interpreter. This documentation explains how the interpreter and the language works. While we try to add complete documentation here, you should refer to some of the examples in the 'examples' directory. Additionally, I recommend that you open a BASIC shell and give some of these commands a try as you read.<br /><br /> I hope you have as much fun using this interpreter as I did making it. Enjoy!</p>

<h3>Language changes:</h3>
<p>I will generally try to avoid drastic language changes, as that creates a mess among existing programs. However, it may occassionally be necessary in order to make things easier. As far as backwards compatibility goes, while it depends on the feature, I may or may not retain the old way of doing something. Backwards compatibility often leads to software bloat, and can discourage changing to the new way. Ultimately, it will depend on the change. If anything, I hope the changes will be in the way of new features.</p>
